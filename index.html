        <p>
          In computer programming, assembly
          language (or assembler language),
          often abbreviated asm,
          is a low-lavel
          programming language.
          it is the nearest
          coding language from
          machine code.

          <h3>Java language</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
          Java is a general-purpose programming
          language that is class-based, object-oriented,
          and designed to have as few
          implementation dependencies as
          possible.
          It is intended to let application developers
          write once, run anywhere (WORA) meaning
          that compiled Java code can run on all
          platforms that support Java without
          the need for recompilation. Java
          applications are typically compiled to
          bytecode that can run on any
          Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless
          of the underlying computer architecture.
          The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++,
          but it has fewer
          low-level facilities than
          either of them. As of 2019, Java was one
          of the most popular programming
          languages in use according to GitHub

          <h3>C language</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
          C is a general-purpose,
          procedural computer programming
          language supporting structured
          programming, lexical variable
          scope, and recursion, while a
          static type system prevents
          unintended operations. By design,
          C provides constructs that map
          efficiently to typical machine
          instructions and has found
          lasting use in applications
          previously coded in assembly
          language. Such applications
          include operating systems and
          various application software
          for computers, from supercomputers
          to embedded systems.

          <h3>C++ language</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
          C++ is a high-level, general-purpose
          programming language created
          by Bjarne Stroustrup as an
          extension of the C programming
          language, or "C with Classes".
          The language has expanded
          significantly over time,
          and modern C++ has
          object-oriented, generic,
          and functional features
          in addition to facilities
          for low-level memory
          manipulation. It is almost
          always implemented as a
          compiled language, and
          many vendors provide C++
          compilers, including the
          Free Software Foundation,
          LLVM, Microsoft, Intel,
          Oracle, and IBM, so it
          is available on many platforms.

        </div>
        <p>
          Python is an interpreted,
          high-level, general-purpose
          programming language. Created
          by Guido van Rossum and first
          released in 1991, Python's
          design philosophy emphasizes
          code readability with its
          notable use of significant
          whitespace. Its language
          constructs and object-oriented
          approach aim to help
          programmers write clear,
          logical code for small and
          large-scale projects. Python
          was conceived in the late
          1980s by Guido van Rossum
          at Centrum Wiskunde &
          Informatica (CWI) in the
          Netherlands as a successor
          to the ABC language
          (itself inspired by SETL),
          capable of exception handling
          and interfacing with the
          Amoeba operating system

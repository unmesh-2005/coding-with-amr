          <p>
            I am Abdullah-al Muntakim Rahman
            living in Bangladesh. I am here to teach
            you guys how to start with programming
            in this website you will find evrything
            you will need to start your programming
            career
          </p>
          <p class="dark">
            Now days we are being more
            depended to computers and modern
            tech. But in the end we mostly don't
            know what we are using and how
            wonderful it is. To know what is
            happening behind the computer screen
            you need to know programming. Teaching
            it is not so easy and so the curious
            people have to buy courses to know
            these thing but in the end they just
            carry some professional skills for
            devolopment but dont know what is happening
            so I hope this course will help you on the go.

            <h3>What We will Do</h3>
            <p>
              We will now try to learn some
              very basics of some programming Languages
              not too fancy or not too hard
              just some basics. And then we will
              get to know what to learn next.
              How to start and what to do
              for being professional.
